Project Title: Eye-Controlled Virtual Mouse

Description:
This project enables users to control the computer mouse using eye movements, leveraging a webcam and computer vision. 
It uses OpenCV for video capture and image processing, MediaPipe for detecting facial landmarks, and PyAutoGUI to control mouse movements and clicks. 
The system tracks the userâ€™s eyes and maps their movements to the screen, allowing hands-free cursor control and click actions. A simple authentication system ensures secure access before using the virtual mouse.

Key Features:

Hands-free cursor control using eye movements

Click detection based on blinking

Secure access via username and password authentication

Real-time tracking and responsive interface
